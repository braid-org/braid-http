To run the braid-http chat demo:

    git clone https://github.com/braid-org/braid-http.git
    cd braid-http/demos/chat
    npm install
    node server.js

Then open https://localhost:3009/ in your browser â€” note that it is https, so you **cannot** simply type "localhost:3009" into the address bar. When the page tries to load, you'll need to click through the warnings to actually open the page, often starting with clicking "advanced".
